# Rails Blog

This is a blog made with rails in order to properly display my awesomeness

## Getting Started

You will want to make an account if you want to be awesome. be sure to contribite to the existing posts. they are the BEST posts, all my Dev friends agree with me there are no better posts. Don't worry about security, I will build a great, great firewall on our system border, and I will have Mexico pay for that firewall. Mark my words.

### Prerequisites

you'll need this function

```
$(function(){
	function(name, desctiption){
		let myName = "Your name"
		let requiremnt = "should pay Reid lots of money to make awesome stuff."
		return myName + " " + requirement
	}
});
```
